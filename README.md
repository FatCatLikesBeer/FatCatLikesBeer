- 👋 Hi, I’m @FatCatLikesBeer (though I'm not a cat and I don't drink much beer ATM).
- 👀 I’m interested in scripting away small problems, automation (hardward & software), mostly Apple stuff (and by extension, Linux).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, python, shell scripting, & how computers work. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software that can successfully replace REKORDBOX, (ximian comes close, I gotta share my edits)
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me here or tweet @itisbilly
