- 👋 Hi, I’m @FatCatLikesBeer (though I'm not a cat, I don't drink much beer ATM, I am a bit chubby).
- 👀 I’m interested in scripting away small problems, automation (hardward & software), mostly Apple stuff (and by extension, Unix/Linux stuff).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Python, (fish) shell scripting, Swift, & how computers work. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software that can successfully replace REKORDBOX, (ximian comes close, I gotta share my edits)
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me here or tweet @itisbilly or @billlaaayyy.bsky.social
